# project information

This project is a fork of drive from rakyll/drive . While the current version of `drive` is maintained by odeke, 
we are looking to produce a minimalized version of drive, so we forked the version from rakyll.

# drive

`drive` is a tiny program to pull or push [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) files. You need at least go1.2 installed in order to build the program.
